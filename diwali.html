		<p>Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most widely celebrated festivals in India and among the Indian diaspora. It marks the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil, symbolizing the victory of knowledge over ignorance. The festival typically lasts five days, with families and communities coming together to illuminate their homes with earthen lamps, candles, and colorful decorations. Diwali is a time for joy, feasting, and exchanging gifts. People clean and decorate their homes, perform religious rituals, and light fireworks to add to the festive atmosphere. The significance of Diwali varies across different regions and communities, but the underlying theme of spreading positivity and embracing the light remains universal. It is a time of renewal and reflection, fostering a sense of unity and togetherness among people of diverse backgrounds.</p>
